This assignment is based on the Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment week 4 of Coursera's Data Science Specialisation by John's Hopkins University.

The data used for this project was downloaded from the following link:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

A more thorough description of the data is available from: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The code found under run_analysis.R in this repository describes the following steps:
1.     Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.     Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.     Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.     Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.     From the data set in step 4, creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

These assignments where obtained from the coursera assignment website.

The following codes read in the text formats of the downloaded data on "training"
train_data_X <- read.table("./getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset/UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt") train_data_Y <- read.table("./getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset/UCI HAR Dataset/train/Y_train.txt") train_data_sub <- read.table ("./getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset/UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt")

The following codes read in the text formats of the downloaded data on "test"
test_data_X <- read.table("./getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset/UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt") test_data_Y <- read.table("./getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset/UCI HAR Dataset/test/Y_test.txt") test_data_sub <- read.table("./getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset/UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt")

The following code reads in the variable names of the features text file
varnames <- read.table("./getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset/UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt")

The following code reads in the activity labels of the activity labels text file
act_labels <- read.table ("./getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset/UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt")

The following code binds the training and test data of X, the training and test data of Y and the subject data of training and test.
X_total <- rbind(train_data_X, test_data_X) Y_total <- rbind(train_data_Y, test_data_Y) total_sub <- rbind(train_data_sub, test_data_sub)

The following code only extracts the mean and standard deviation columns of the variable names data set and assigns these variable names to the merged X dataset
varnames_sel <- varnames[grep("mean|std",varnames[,2]),] X_total <- X_total[,varnames_sel[,1]] View(X_total)

Activity labels are included in the dataset by the following code
colnames(Y_total) <- "activity" Y_total$activitylabel <- factor(Y_total$activity, labels = as.character(act_labels[,2])) activitylabel <- Y_total[,-1]

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
colnames(X_total) <- varnames[varnames_sel[,1],2] View(X_total)

The following code creates a new dataset (mean_complete) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
colnames(total_sub) <- "Subject" complete <- cbind(X_total, activitylabel, total_sub)
library(dplyr) mean_complete <- complete %>% group_by(activitylabel, Subject) %>% summarize_each(funs(mean)) write.table(mean_complete, file = "./getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset/UCI HAR Dataset/dataset_tidy.txt", row.names = FALSE)
dataset_tidy <- read.table("./getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset/UCI HAR Dataset/dataset_tidy.txt") View(dataset_tidy)
